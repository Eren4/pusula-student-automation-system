# Student Automation App
A full-stack student automation web application for managing students, teachers, grades, courses, etc.  

.NET 9 was used for the backend, and React for the frontend.  

This was my first time creating a full-stack app with these frameworks, so I spent time learning and discovering the tools as I built, so I was slow, that is why the admin functionalities couldn't be implemented due to deadline.  

To run the backend part, hit CTRL + F5 on Visual Studio while the window is in Program.cs  

To run the frontend part, navigate to student-frontend, install dependencies with "npm install", then type "npm run dev" from the command line.
